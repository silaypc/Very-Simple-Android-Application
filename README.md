# Very-Simple-Android-Application
Simple Android application made in Android Studio for personal practice. It doesn't actually generate an account - this was done to test data transfer between two activities and custom spinners and dialogs. Uploaded as a .zip file because apparently github doesn't allow projects with more than 100 files. Written in Java.
